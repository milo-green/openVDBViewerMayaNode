Before you start it is assumed you have already downloaded and built the openvdb library (http://www.openvdb.org/)

Building requires CMake 2.6 or later.

------------BASICS---------------

After compiling the openvdb library, you only need to set five more things:

1. Where the Maya you build against is located.

2. Where the VDB includes and libs you build against are located.

3. Where the BOOST includes you build against are located.

3. Where the OPENEXR includes you build against are located.

5. Where to install the resulting plugins, MEL scripts & icons.


1. is set a variable called MAYA_DIR. This is the root
folder of your Maya installation and requires the Maya Development Kit
to be present, in the default location.

2. set  a variable called VDB_DIR. This is the root
folder of your openVDB installation and requires /include and /lib sub-directories

3. set  a variable called BOOST_DIR. This is the root
folder of your BOOST installation and requires /include sub-directories, note this should be the same version you used to build the openvdb library with

4. set  a variable called OPENEXR_DIR. This is the root
folder of your openEXR installation and requires include sub-directories containing: OpenEXR/half.h

5. is the output location for the install target, when invoked.
This uses the default variable, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. So if you don't
set this, it will use your platform's default (e.g. /usr/local, on
CMake Linux).



------------BOURNE SHELL BUILD---------------
A typical build session for a Bourne shell would look something like
this:

  
  export MAYA_DIR=/usr/autodesk/maya2011
  export VDB_DIR=/path/to/openVDB/openvdb_1_1_0
  export BOOST_DIR=/path/to/boost/boost/1.44.0
  export OPENEXR_DIR=/path/to/OpenEXR/1.6.1

  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../mayaInstallFiles -DMAYA_DIR=$MAYA_DIR  -DOPENEXR_DIR=$OPENEXR_DIR -DBOOST_DIR=$BOOST_DIR -DVDB_DIR=$VDB_DIR -Bbuild ..
  make
  sudo make install

------------ ALTERNATE TCSH SHELL BUILD---------------

  setenv MAYA_DIR /usr/autodesk/maya2011
  setenv VDB_DIR /path/to/openVDB/openvdb_1_1_0
  setenv BOOST_DIR /path/to/boost/boost/1.44.0
  setenv OPENEXR_DIR /path/to/OpenEXR/1.6.1

  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../mayaInstallFiles -DMAYA_DIR=$MAYA_DIR  -DOPENEXR_DIR=$OPENEXR_DIR -DBOOST_DIR=$BOOST_DIR -DVDB_DIR=$VDB_DIR -Bbuild ..

  make
  sudo make install

  ------------INSTALL NOTES---------------


However, to allow using specific install locations three additional
variables are supported:

  MAYA_PLUGIN_DIR
  MAYA_SCRIPT_DIR
  MAYA_ICON_DIR


If omitted, these just inherit their locations from
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:

  MAYA_PLUGIN_DIR = $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/plug-ins
  MAYA_SCRIPT_DIR = $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/scripts/others
  MAYA_ICON_DIR   = $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/icons


 ------------LINKING AND LD LIBRARY PATH NOTES---------------

  NOTE: once compiled,  + when loading maya you must make sure the openvdb library you linked agaist is in the LD_LIBRARY path i.e
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/path/to/openvdb/lib:
